# Webume

This project is my full resume. The goal was to use ONLY <b>HTML/CSS/Javascript</b>. Since it is on the web, I prefer calling it <i>Webume</i>, instead of just Resume.

Here is the link to my Webume <i>https://yakupatahanov.github.io/yakup-atahanov.github.io/</i>

The website is running on GitHub Pages. Webume represents all my experiences and will never reach a "finished project" state.
